Overview
*********

The output of our electrophysiology system is a time varying voltage signal. We expect extracellular potentials generated by nearby neurons to have some protypical features or shape that is different from noise, and that one neuron would also have differences from another. We can chose to make these comparisons looking at the time varying voltage trace that we are given, or we could perform some transformation of this signal to try to accentuate what we expect to be discriminatory components of the signal. 

Each feature extraction method needs
1) Type with fields necessary for algorithm
2) function "feature" to operate on sort with type field defined above
3) any other necessary functions for extraction algorithm

Sometimes during calibration periods these features need to be calculated a little differently to make more or less data available to the subsequent calibration of clustering or reduction steps. These methods can be defined in "featureprepare" methods.

All data types are of abstract type Feature. they should have default constructors that are initialized as follows:

.. code-block:: julia

	myfeature=FeatureTime() #use the time varying voltage signal as is

	myfeature=FeatureCurv() #use the curvature of the voltage signal
